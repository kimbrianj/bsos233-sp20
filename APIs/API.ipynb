In the present invention, genes encoding protective antigens of unrelated bacterial, viral, parasitic, or fungal pathogens are expressed in an attenuated bacterial vaccine strain that delivers these foreign antigens to the immune system, thereby eliciting relevant immune responses. Rather than expressing these antigens using only low copy expression plasmids, expression of foreign proteins is accomplished using both low copy expression plasmids in conjunction with chromosomal integrations within the same live vector. This strategy compensates for the inherent disadvantage of loss of gene dosage (versus exclusive plasmid-based expression) by integrating antigen expression cassettes into multiple chromosomal sites already inactivated in an attenuated vector.'},\n",

Pore lifetime enhancement strategies can increase effectiveness of MNs as a drug delivery mechanism by prolonging the delivery window. Fluvastatin (FLU) was used to enhance pore lifetime by inhibiting the synthesis of cholesterol, a major component of the stratum corneum lipids. The skin recovered within a 30-45-min time period following the removal of occlusion, and there was no significant irritation observed due to the treatment compared to the control sites. Thus, it can be concluded that localized skin treatment with FLU can be used to extend micropore lifetime and deliver drugs for up to 7 days across MN-treated skin.'},\n",

In addition to the conventional four-medium model which gives an averaged refractive index, an adaptive multilayer model which takes into account an increasing number of layers as the evaporation proceeded is developed to monitor the instantaneous changes of the refractive index. Each ellipsometric measurement lasts only 0.5s and provides two sets of refractive index and thickness data as derived by the two multilayer models. Both measured data are used for the refractive index control to achieve a good feedback response. This fast and sensitive measurement technique makes possible the feedback control of the refractive index in real time which in turn allows for better control of the deposition condition and also improves the reproducibility of the AR coating process. By combining the two measured refractive indices and using the weighted average as the control factor, precise control of the average refractive index within .+-.0.01 can be achieved and traveling-wave semiconductor laser amplifiers and superluminescent LEDs with facet reflectivities of order 10.sup.--5 or less are obtained reproducibly for a single layer coating.

This technique uses a structured vector quantization (SVQ) technique for optimal shaping of the constellation. Optimal (N-sphere) SVQ shaping results in higher shaping gains than those of Voronoi constellations based on known N-dimensional lattices. For a given CER.sub.2 (or PAR.sub.2) SVQ shaping results in optimal shaping. This is useful for implementation over QAM modems as significant shaping gains can be achieved even for a small constellation expansion. The SVQ-shaped constellations have a very reasonable implementation complexity. They allow for the possibility of opportunistic secondary channels, and there constituent 2D constellations are invariant to .pi./2 phase rotations (assuming cubic lattice based constellations). Compatibility of SVQ shaping with trellis coding was also demonstrated, resulting in the SVQ-shaped trellis-coded modulation scheme which can realize both shaping and coding gains. For transmission over ISI channels, SVQ shaping can be used together with the precoding scheme to realize shaping gains up to 1.15 dB.'},\n",

All organisms have a basal level of thermotolerance--an organism-specific temperature threshold above which they die. The advantage to increased thermotolerance in a plant is clear--increased thermotolerance improves crop yield in particularly hot growing seasons, and expands the geographic area where a particular crop can be grown. The present invention provides a method of increasing thermotolerance in plants comprising transforming plant cells with a vector which over-expresses the carrot Hsp17.7 gene. This is the first demonstration of enhancement of plant thermotolerance through the over-expression of a low molecular weight heat shock protein. Additionally, the fact that the enhanced thermotolerance effect can be transferred from one species (carrot) to a completely unrelated species (tomato) is highly significant, as it demonstrates that this gene construct is able to confer enhanced thermotolerance to a wide range of plant species. \"'},\n",

Since the SV40 virus utilizes the host\\'s cellular proteins for its own DNA replication, our results indicate that the DNA synthesome plays a role not only in viral DNA synthesis but in human breast cell DNA replication as well. Our studies demonstrate that the following DNA proteins are incorporated into the DNA synthesome: DNA polymerase .alpha., DNA primase, DNA polymerase .delta., proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), replication protein A (RP-A), replication protein C (RF-C), DNA topoisomerase I and II, and DNA polymerase .epsilon..

In the key pre-distribution phase, prior to DSN deployment, a ring of keys is distributed to each sensor node, each key ring consisting of randomly chosen keys from a large pool of keys which is generated off-line. A shared key exists between each two key rings with a predetermined probability. In the shared key discovery phase, which takes place upon deployment of the DSN, every sensor node discovers its neighbors in wireless communication range with which it shares keys, and the topology of the sensor array is established by forming secure communication links between respective sensor nodes. The path key establishment phase assigns a path key to selected pairs of sensor nodes in wireless communication range that do not share a key but are connected by two or more links at the end of the shared key discovery phase. The key management scheme also assumes a revocation phase for removal of the key ring of the compromised sensor node from the network. Also, re-keying phase is assumed for removal of those keys with the expired lifetime.'},\n",

       "   'patent_abstract': 'A probabilistic framework for acoustic-phonetic automatic speech recognition organizes a set of phonetic features into a hierarchy consisting of a broad manner feature sub-hierarchy and a fine phonetic feature sub-hierarchy. Each phonetic feature of said hierarchy corresponds to a set of acoustic correlates and each broad manner feature of said broad manner feature sub-hierarchy is further associated with a corresponding set of acoustic landmarks. A pattern recognizer is trained from a knowledge base of phonetic features and corresponding acoustic correlates. Acoustic correlates are extracted from a speech signal and are presented to the pattern recognizer. Acoustic landmarks are identified and located from broad manner classes classified by the pattern recognizer. Fine phonetic features are determined by the pattern recognizer at and around the acoustic landmarks. The determination of fine phonetic features may be constrained by a pronunciation model. The most probable feature bundles corresponding to words and sentences are those that maximize the joint a posteriori probability of the fine phonetic features and corresponding acoustic landmarks. When the hierarchy is organized as a binary tree, binary classifiers such as Support Vector Machines can be used in the pattern classifier and the outputs thereof can be converted probability measures which, in turn may be used in the computation of the aforementioned joint probability of fine phonetic features and corresponding landmarks.'},\n",

Traffic flows are aggregated and packets are intentionally dropped from the flow aggregate in accordance with an assigned perturbation signature. The flow aggregates are observed to determine if the rate of arrival of packets that have a one-to-one transmission correspondence with the dropped packets are similarly responsive to the perturbation signature. By assigning orthogonal perturbation signatures to different routers, multiple routers may perform the test on the aggregate and the results of the test will be correctly ascertained at each router.

(3R)-β-Cryptoxanthin and (3R,6′R)-α-cryptoxanthin are two rare food carotenoids that are not commercially available and the former exhibits vitamin A activity. In the first synthetic step, commercially available lutein and/or lutein esters are transformed into a mixture of dehydration products of lutein (anhydroluteins) in the presence of a catalytic amount of an acid. The resulting anhydroluteins are then converted to (3R)-β-cryptoxanthin (major product) and (3R,6′R)-α-cryptoxanthin (minor product) by heterogeneous catalytic hydrogenation employing transition elements of group VIII (Pt, Pd, Rh supported on alumina or carbon) in a variety of organic solvents under atmospheric pressure of hydrogen and at temperatures ranging from −15° C. to 40° C. Among these catalysts, Pt supported on alumina at 40° C. in ethyl acetate provides the best yield of (3R)-β-cryptoxanthin and (3R,6′R)-α-cryptoxanthin.

The NCCa-ATP channel is newly expressed in neural tissue following injury such as ischemia, and is regulated by the sulfonylurea receptor SUR1, being inhibited by sulfonylurea compounds, e.g., glibenclamide and tolbutamide, and opened by diazoxide. Antagonists of the NCCa-ATP channel, including SUR1 antagonists, are useful in the prevention, diminution, and treatment of injured or diseased neural tissue, including astrocytes, neurons and capillary endothelial cells, that is due to ischemia, tissue trauma, brain swelling and increased tissue pressure, or other forms of brain or spinal cord disease or injury. Agonists of the NCCa-ATP channel may be are useful in the treatment neural tissue where damage or destruction of the tissue, such as a gliotic capsule, is desired.'},\n",

The technique relies on identification of prominent features at the image, as well as corresponding directions of propagation of signals manifested by the prominent features at the image, and computation of similarity metric between signals corresponding to the prominent features in the image. The time delays between the correlated signals (i.e., source signal and related reflections) are found and the signals are added coherently. Multiple beamformers operate on the source signal and corresponding reflections, enabling one to improve the signal-to-noise ratio in multi-path environments.'},\n",

The long range (up to and beyond 100 m) efficient (as high as and above 50%) energy transfer is achieved due to minimizing (or eliminating) losses in the system. Superconducting materials are used for all current carrying elements, dielectrics are either avoided altogether, or those are used with a low dissipation factor, and the system is operated at reduced frequencies (below 1 MHz). The oscillators are contoured as a compact flat coil formed from a superconducting wire material. The energy wavelengths exceed the coils diameter by several orders of magnitude. The reduction in radiative losses is enhanced by adding external dielectric-less electrical capacitance to each oscillator coil to reduce the operating frequency. The dielectric strength of the capacitor is increased by applying a magnetic cross-field to the capacitor to impede the electrons motion across an air gap defined between coaxial cylindrical electrodes.'},\n",
