    "Pretend you are working for a fictional company, and you have been asked to explore a dataset with regard to a certain policy/action/decision.  You can take some liberties with this scenario, but make sure there is a concrete plan of action that you recommend at the end.  Write a report **describing the problem of interest**, using **descriptive statistics** to learn more about the data, running a **prediction** analysis, and **recommending a plan of action** based on the results of your analyses."

    "## Data\n",
    "\n",
    "You may choose to use one of the provided datasets or to use your own data.  If you want to use yourown data,  I would highly recommend sending me a copy so that I can look at it and verify that itworks for what you want to do.The provided datasets can be found in the `data` folder in JupyterHub\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Guidelines\n",
    "\n",
    "In your report, you must include:\n",
    "- A clear description of the **question of interest** and the variables you are studying.\n",
    "- **Descriptive statistics and visualizations** that help the reader understand the data better.\n",
    "- A **prediction** model using linear regression or classification.\n",
    "- A clear **conclusion** based on your analysis, including a clear **plan of action.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure you have a reason for looking at the variables that you did, and motivate why you chose those variables in the introduction. Write your report in a separate Jupyter Notebook, formatting it so that the code is included with the text. Make sure to include a title and section headings by using '#' symbols in Markdown formatting.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Description\n",
    "\n",
    "You should start the project with a short description of the **problem of interest**. This must be something that you can propose an action on.  Examples of good formulations of the problem are:\n",
    "- Is smoking associated with a higher rate of low birthweight babies?\n",
    "- What are the main factors associated with higher grades in a class?\n",
    "\n",
    "In  each  of  these  cases, a conclusion  and  associated  plan  of  action  could  be  aimed  at  answered the following questions:\n",
    "- Should we ban smoking during pregnancy?\n",
    "- What should we do to improve grades?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Descriptive Statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "You must describe the key variables in your project. Your graphs must be related to the problem of interest and the key outcome(s). Make sure you include **numerical and/or graphical summaries** of each of your variables. Generally, it might be helpful to use this section to explore the **relationship between your outcome variable and your other variables.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prediction\n",
    "\n",
    "You must include at least one **prediction** component in your final project. This can be in the form of a **linear regression** or **classification** analysis. Make sure you use the appropriate method for the variable you are studying! You may need to do some data cleaning in order to get it in a state that you can use.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some examples of prediction analyses are:\n",
    "- Predicting whether a baby has lowbirthweight or not using various characteristics about the birth.\n",
    "- Using a linear regression to predict grades and interpreting what various parts of the equation mean, and the implications of these.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "You must make some sort of proposal for a **plan of action**. This should be directly related to the problem you described at the very beginning. Some conclusions might look like:\n",
    "- We should ban smoking for pregnant mothers.\n",
    "- We should focus on helping students get more hours of tutoring.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Some Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "When formulating your research question, think about how it might be used. **You need to have a policy/action that you suggest at the end.** That is, a prediction model is useless if you have no way of using it.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will likely do some analysis that doesn't make it into the final submission of your mini-project report. Include them in an appendix section at the end! This might include\n",
    "- Preliminary graphs and summary statistics of variables you considered, but didn't use\n",
    "- Data cleaning steps \n",
    "- More in-depth discussion of the code used in your analysis"
